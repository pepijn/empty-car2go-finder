Car2go empty car finder
-----------------------

This is a native iOS version of a [website built in 2013](http://plict.nl/car2go/).

The pins on the map represent available Car2go vehicles. The colors indicate whether you will get free minutes when you attach the car to a charging station after driving.

- Green: charge is <30%, you will get the reward
- Yellow: charge is a little more than 30%, you will get the reward if you lose enough battery charge while driving
- Blue: there is a small chance of getting the reward while driving an average distance
